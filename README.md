# Overview

This is an app that is for drawing on an Android. It allows users to draw/paint as well as save their artwork they create! It provides a canvas that they can use to draw and erase or clear. They can also save their drawings to their device.

I created this app to demonstrate the simple usage of an Android app. It was also to practice and grow my understanding of programming mobile apps.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio (Jellyfish) to develop this app as well as Visual Studio Code to write this markup. 

Kotlin language was used to create the app itself as well as make it work.

# Future Work

* I will continue to add styles so that this app will begin working once again.
* I will make it so that you can send your photos to other people through the app.
* I want to add stickers that you can add to your drawing.
